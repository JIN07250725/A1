/* 

Read the employee ID number (an int) from the user

Read the number of hours worked (an int) from the user

Read the hourly rate (an int) from the user

Read the federal withholding rate (an int, e.g., 10)

You must read one input per line. Please see the sample run below. This is part of the required coding construct.

Your program should calculate the total gross pay, the Income Tax Withholding, and the net pay.

First calculate the total gross pay from the hours worked and the hourly rate inputs.

Then calculate the Federal Tax withholding using the gross pay and the federal withholding rate.

Then calculate the Net Pay by subtracting the federal tax withholding from the gross pay.

Program Name:

Program Description:

Design:
A. INPUT
Define the input variables including name data type. 
int employee_id = 0;

B. OUTPUT
Define the output variables including data types. 

C. CALCULATIONS
Describe calculations used by algorithms in step D.  
List all formulas. 
If there are no calculations needed, state there are no calculations.

D. LOGIC and ALGORITHMS
Design the logic of your program using pseudocode or flowcharts. 
Use conditionals, loops, functions or array constructs.
List the steps in transforming inputs into outputs.
